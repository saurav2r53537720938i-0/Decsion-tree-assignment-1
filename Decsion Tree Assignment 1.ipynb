    "A decsion tree classfier algorithim is a type of suoervised machine learning algorthim used for classfication task.it works by recursively partitioning the data into subset based on the value of input feature.\n",
    "1. Tree Construction:The algorthim starts with the entire dataset at the root node.it then slects the best feature to split the data based on certain ciriteria typically aiming to maximize information gain or minimize impurity.\n",
    "2. Node Splitting:The slected feature is used to split the dataset into two or more subset.Each subset reprsented a diffrent branch of the tree,and this process is repeatedrecursively for each subset until one of the stopping ciriteria is met.\n",
    "3. Stoppoing Cirteria: The recursive splitting process stops when one of the following condtions is met.All data point in a subset belong to the same class.There are no more feature to split on.A predefined maxium depth of the tree is reached.A minimum number data points in a node is reached"
